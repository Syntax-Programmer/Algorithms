# Algorithms
This has too many algorithms compiled together.

I have implemented top 250 algorithms that chatGPT gave me.

This is supposed to be a al in one guide for people looking for implementation of theses algorithms.<br>
They are implemented using simple syntax so that any beginner also looking at this might not feel overwhelmed.
